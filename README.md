# FormPoison
Form Input Fuzzing Framework made with Python based on my experience with data validation issues and XSS attacks executed by me.
It automates testing common missconfigurations in input fields.

*Tip: use some payloads even if they are not being executed directly on the page, they could work if they are being displayed on different endpoints.*
