# FormPoison ðŸ“„ðŸ’‰
Form Input Fuzzing Framework made with Python based on my experience with data validation issues and XSS attacks executed by me.
It automates testing common missconfigurations in sanitization in input fields.<p> There is also payload list (my own + AI generated and these frequently used by bounty hunters). 

Type <code>python3 formposion.py -h</code> for possible usage. 

*Tip: use some payloads even if they are not being executed directly on the page, they could work if they are being displayed on different endpoints.*
